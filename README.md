# smartrace_events

A flutter project to consume SmartRace data events and update Govee bluetooth and Network aware light systems to reflect certain data events. The system currently updates weather events with different colors to help drivers know the current track conditions (dry, about to rain, wet, about to dry up) as well as race stop and restart events.
